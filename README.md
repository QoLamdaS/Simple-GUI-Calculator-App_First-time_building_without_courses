# Simple GUI Calculator App
(This is the very first time I am trying to build project without courses "professionally" adhering SDLC principles waterfall model)

## SDLC principles waterfall model *roughly* : Requirement > Design > Implementation > Testing > Maintenance

### 1. Requirement Analysis :
1. Core Features (MVP): Handles basic arithmetic [Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division]
2. Constraints: fixed-size windows, division by zero??

### 2. Design :
A. UI Sketching
- Rows and columns of buttons? 4×5 grid
- Highly similar to Windows Standard Calculator for UI
- "=" button colored differently

B. Logic
- Honestly I have no idea. Temporarily skipped for this.

C. Tech Stack Selection
- Use PyQt (I ambitious use PyQt for the first time, hopefully goes well)
